- U-Boot 2019.07 is used by default;

- bootflow is (in order):
  
  - ZSBL (ROM);
  
  - FSBL (uSD, partition #2);
  
  - OpenSBI + U-Boot (uSD, partition #3);
  
  - Linux kernel (uSD, partition #1).

- GCC 9.1.0;

- binutils 2.32.0;

- GDB 8.3.

## Known Issues

1. Avoid overclocking SOC using CPUFreq if you are using HiFive Unleashed Expansion Board from Microsemi as this will hang the board. Hard reset will be required.

2. You might notice sluggish Xfce4 performance on the first boot if you are using HiFive Unleashed Expansion Board from Microsemi with GPU. Rebooting seems to resolve the issue.
